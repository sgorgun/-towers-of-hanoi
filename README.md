# Towers of Hanoi

## Description

There are `3 towers` and `n disks` of different diameters which can slide onto any tower. Disks are sorted in ascending order of diameter from top to bottom (that is, each disk is located on top of a larger diameter disk). 
- Implement the algorithm for moving the disks of the first tower to the third recursively. The following restrictions apply:
  - Only one drive can be moved at a time.
  - The disk slid from the top of one tower to another tower.
  - A disc cannot be placed on top of a smaller disc.     
  See additional information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi).
- Develop unit tests.
